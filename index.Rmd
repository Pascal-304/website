## About Me

I am currently a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Actuarial Science and Statistics at the University of Toronto. I am aspiring to become an actuarial analyst. I was born and raised in Mauritius. I enjoy hiking and listening to music. If you ever had a chance to visit Mauritius, I recommend hiking Le Pouce mountain and visit Eau Bleue.
